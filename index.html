                <p>
                    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are a revolutionary technology for both military and civilian use. They are
                    utilized for surveillance, disaster relief, agriculture, among other applications, for combat operations and transportation.
                    The basis of UAV operations rests in robust communication systems that enable facile interaction among UAVs, ground
                    control stations, and networked devices. This paper discusses various communication technologies that make UAVs function
                    properly, including radio frequency, satellite, and 5G networks. The paper further discusses the network architectural
                    designs of UAVs in different forms, for example, centralized and decentralized forms, and identifies the challenges such
                    as bandwidth constraints, interference, and security threats. Moreover, the essay discusses the future prospect of UAVs
                    by pointing towards artificial intelligence, machine learning, and power-efficient algorithm development to enhance
                    their autonomy and efficiency. While addressing these factors, the essay emphasizes the key role of the communication
                    system in achieving the full potential of UAVs in various industries.

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>In our rapidly evolving world, the dynamics of flights have change drastically, from just a concept
                    to the first ever successful flight by Orville Wright, one of the Wright brothers to first ever
                    passenger plane and then fighter jets. Where passenger planes helps millinos of passengers to go
                    from one place to another, Military fighter jets plays a vital role in wars and close combat
                    dockfight.
                    <br>
                    Later after losing so many lives in world war, people started thinking about the planes where we
                    don't need a pilot physically within the plane, it is how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were
                    developed. UAVs are the most advanced technology in aviation sector. They are
                    used for various purposes like surveillance, and even combat missions. You can complete any mission
                    while sitting in your own country. As you are not physically present in the plane, you can
                    control the UAVs from a distance. This is possible because of the communication between UAVs and the
                    ground stations.
                    The UAVs incorporate various communication technologies that enable them to communicate with ground
                    stations. They have radio frequency, satellite, cellular (4G/5G), Wi-Fi, LoRa, and other numerous
                    technologies. Communication of UAVs to ground stations is essential for their functioning. This
                    essay will discuss the different aspects of communication with UAVs, such as technologies,
                    challenges, applications, and future directions. <span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref1"

                <p>
                    Communication with UAVs are important as there is no pilot physically present in the UAV. So, entire
                    communication is done wirelessly. The UAVs are controlled from distance. Hence, then range of
                    communication should be large enough to send and receive data. To make sure proper communication,
                    UAVs are equipped with various technologies.

                    The CNPC links are crucial to ensure that all UAV systems are safely operated. They should be highly
                    reliable, low-latency, secure two way communications, and must requires low data rate. So that, it
                    can be used for exchanging safety-critical infomration with other UAVs and also between UAVs ad
                    ground control stations. There are three main types of CNPC infromation flows:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <ul class="tech-list">
                    <li>Command and control from GCS to UAVs</li>
                    <li>Aircraft status report from UAVs to ground</li>
                    <li>Sense-and-avoid information among UAVs</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To support critical functions, CNPC links should operate in protected frequency bands. The most
                    common frequency bands used for CNPC links are: L-band (960-977MHz) and C-band (5030-5091MHz) <span
                        class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref2" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref2')">[2]</span>. Moreover, though
                    the direct links between UAVs and GCP are the most common and preferred for delay reasons, secondly,
                    links via satellite could also be used as backup to make sure if something goes wrong with the
                    direct link, the UAVs can still be controlled via satellite. Another key aspect fo CNPC links is
                    superior security. In particular, effective security controls must be applied to avoid so-called
                    ghost control, a very risky scenario under
                    which the UAVs are taken over by unauthorised actors via spoofed navigation or control signals. In
                    this regard, strong
                    authentication protocols, perhaps supported by the advancing physical layer security techniques,
                    should be employed on
                    CNPC connections.

                <p>
                    The data links are used to support mission-related communications for ground stations, which depends
                    on different scenarios, may include mobile terminals, geteway nodes, wireless sensors, and so on.
                    UAVs data links need to support these communication modes:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <ul class="tech-list">

                    <li>UAV-UAV wireless backhaul</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The capacity demand of these data links depends significantly on the applications, which can range
                    from a few kilobits
                    per second for UAV-sensor links to dozens of gigabits per second for UAV-gateway wireless backhaul.
                    Compared with CNPC
                    links, the data links usually have greater tolerance in latency and security demands. In the
                    spectrum space, the UAV
                    data links could reuse the previously assigned band for the respective applications to be supported,
                    (e.g., the LTE band
                    in supporting cellular coverage), or new special spectrum would be available for performance
                    optimization (e.g., using
                    the millimeter-wave, mmWave, band for high-capacity UAV-UAV wireless backhaul) <span class="ref-btn"

                <h1>Communication Architecture</h1>
                <p>
                    A communication architecture specifies how information flows between the ground crew and a UAV or
                    between UAVs. In this
                    section we introduce four communication architectures for networking UAVs. <span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref4" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref4')">[4]</span>

                <h3>Centralized Communication</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A central UAV communications topology is illustrated in Fig with a central node (i.e., the ground
                    station), to which
                    all the UAVs are linked. It is one of the most common network topologies. In this network, each UAV
                    sends and receives
                    command and control messages directly with the ground station, and UAVs are not directly connected
                    with one another. The
                    whole network is rooted at the ground station, and in between two UAVs, messages need to be relayed
                    via the ground
                    station. Since all UAVs are directly connected with the ground station, there can be little delay in
                    information when
                    command and control data are shared between the ground personnel and an UAV. But data information
                    exchanged between two
                    UAVs will experience a relatively longer delay since the data must be transmitted through the ground
                    station. Also,
                    since long-distance communication tends to be performed between the ground station and UAVs,
                    high-power radio
                    transmission gear is required in the UAVs, which will not be cost-effective for medium or small UAVs
                    due to their size
                    and payload restrictions. Also, in the centralised UAV communication architecture, the ground
                    station represents
                    weakness of the UAV network by having the potential of single-point of failure. I.e., if the ground
                    station experiences
                    some problem, the entire UAV network will be impacted. Thus, this communication architecture is not
                    robust <span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref4" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref4')">[4]</span>.

                <h3>Decentralized Communications</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In decentralized UAV communications, central ground stations are not required. Each UAV can
                    communicate with each other directly or indirectly without needing Ground station. If information
                    needs to be send then it will be send through other UAVs. This is a more robust communication
                    architecture as there is no single point of failure. If one UAV fails, the other UAVs can still
                    communicate with each other. This architecture is more cost-effective as it does not require
                    high-power radio transmission gear. However, this architecture has a longer delay in information
                    exchange as compared to centralized communication. Let's discuss more about 3 types of decentralized
                    communication architectures:
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Ad-hoc Communication</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An ad hoc network for a UAV is infrastructureless, with the UAVs relaying data between them. A
                    gateway UAV offers
                    connectivity to a ground station using two radios, while the network is connected to it. This setup
                    offers extended
                    coverage and enables lightweight, low-cost transceivers. For persistent connectivity, the UAVs must
                    be moving at
                    comparable speed and direction, making coordinated missions like surveillance suitable. In bigger
                    deployments with
                    varying UAVs, several clusters or layered structures (multi-group or multi-layer networks) are
                    better suited to handle
                    communication and less overhead.

                <h3>2. Multi-Group UAV Network</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In a multi-group UAV network, UAVs form independent groups and each group builds its own ad hoc
                    network having a
                    backbone UAV connected to a ground station. Local communication happens within a group, while
                    inter-group communication
                    transpires through their backbone UAVs and the ground station. Such a structure balances centralized
                    and ad hoc
                    structures, making it very suitable for extensive missions involving different types of
                    heterogeneous UAVs. Its
                    semi-centralized nature could limit overall resilience.

                <br>
                <p>
                    A multi-layer UAV ad hoc network organizes UAVs into clusters at a lower layer, and their backbone UAVs form an
                    upper-layer ad hoc network. Unlike the multi-group model, a single backbone UAV is connected to the ground station, and
                    inter-group communication is directly performed via the upper layer, without involving the ground station. This reduces
                    load on the ground station and achieves maximum scalability. It is most appropriate for one-to-many UAV operations and
                    is less susceptible to a single point of failure.

                <h1>Design Considerations for UAV Networks</h1>
                <p>
                    UAV networks have several important design points because of their unique nature. In this section, we discuss briefly
                    the nature, mobility models, and architecture of UAV networks. Because of sudden changes, and activities while the
                    network is operating, UAV networks require high scalability, flexibility, and robust communication protocols <span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref5" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref5')">[5]</span>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>A. Topology</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    UAVs form peer-to-peer connections to maintain coordincation and communication; either single or multi-cluster formations can be be used. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>B. Mobility Models</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Mobility models are essential for efficient UAV communication and are based on the application and UAV size (large,
                    small, mini). For scheduled missions, UAVs follow regular mobility, whereas autonomous systems require dynamic models.
                    For collective military operations, RPGMM (e.g., Manhattan grid) is suitable; for flexible routes such as patrolling,
                    models like random waypoint or Gaussâ€“Markov are used. UAVs are highly mobile (30â€“460 km/h) in comparison to VANET or
                    MANET nodes, causing wireless link oscillations and affecting routing performance. Efficient routing and MAC protocols
                    are hence crucial to maintain connectivity and QoS.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>C. Latency</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Disaster monitoring and battlefield operations require ultra-low latency for FANETs. While some latency is inevitable,
                    it can be minimized by using priority schemes, priority-based routing, and efficient collision and congestion control
                    protocols. Routing protocol selection is especially crucial in providing QoS. Highly mobile FANET delay can be addressed
                    by a study proposing an adaptive delay-constrained routing method based on a stochastic model that allows packet
                    transmission from local information alone.

                <p>
                    There are few challenges for UAVs, like: security of sensitive data, bandwidth limitation, hijacking using malicious frequency and all.
                    <br>
                    Limited transmission range, interference from other devices, slow speed makes it valnurable and can be shoot down easily<span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref5" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref5')">[5]</span>.

                <p>
                    We have seen a lot of applications of UAVs in civil and military sectors. In civil sector, UAVs are used for different purposes like
                    surveillance, monitoring, and even in agriculture. UAVs are used to monitor the crops and also to spray pesticides. Amazon uses drones to deliver packages to customers. Drones replaced Helicopters in shooting movies. 
                    <br>
                    In military sector, UAVs are used for different purposes like combat missions, you can use advance drones to target enemies preciesly and from different countrry. UAVs are capable of carrying bombs and missiles, advance combat drones uses solar power which helps them to airborne for long time.
                    <br>
                    US used drones in Afghanistan and Iraq to keep an eye on enemies, they used to fly so high and capture a lot of data, as they were equipped with high resolution cameras.
                    <br>
                    Apart from these, UAVs are also used in search and rescue missions, disaster management, and lot more <span class="ref-btn" data-ref="ref7" onclick="openRefSidebar('ref7')">[7]</span>.

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>
                    Communication systems can be considered as the backbone of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and because of these, it is possible to
                    make them flying very smoothly and use them in various situations like surveillance, relief work during disasters, and
                    wartime operations.
                    Diverse communication technologies, structures, and UAV networking challenges have been discussed in this essay. From
                    distributed and centralized communication to current technologies like satellite communication, 5G, each plays an important role to support secure and robust UAV operations. However, bandwidth limitation,
                    interference, and security loopholes are still major issues.
